Obsidian Applications
=====================

`obsidian-server` and `obsidian-worker` are the apllications required to
run the inversion.

`obsidian-analyise` takes a csv file of samples produced by obsidian and
outputs voxelisations of marginal distributions over the various layers
and properties.

`prior-sampler` samples N times from the prior and saves to csv.
